Service Principal Name - SQL Server
March 30, 2023
A Service Principal Name (SPN) is a unique identifier for a service instance in a Windows environment. In SQL Server, SPNs are used to specify the identity under which a particular SQL Server service runs, which is necessary for Kerberos authentication and delegation in a Windows Active Directory environment.

Here is a detailed explanation of SPNs in SQL Server

1. What is an SPN?

An SPN is a unique name that identifies a service instance running on a computer. It is used by Kerberos authentication to associate a service instance with a service account. An SPN is made up of the service class, hostname, and port number (if applicable) that the service is running on.

2. Why are SPNs important in SQL Server?

In SQL Server, SPNs are important because they are used to enable Kerberos authentication, which provides a more secure and efficient method for authenticating users than NTLM authentication. Kerberos authentication allows users to authenticate once and then reuse their credentials to access other resources on the network without having to re-enter their password. It also allows for delegation, which allows a service to access resources on behalf of a user.

3. How do you register an SPN in SQL Server?

To register an SPN for a SQL Server service, you can use the SETSPN utility provided by Microsoft. The syntax for using SETSPN to register an SPN for a SQL Server service is as follows:

setspn -s MSSQLSvc/<servername>:<port> <domain>\<accountname>

where:

<servername> is the name of the SQL Server instance
<port> is the port number used by the SQL Server instance (default is 1433)
<domain>\<accountname> is the domain and account name of the SQL Server service account
For example, to register an SPN for a SQL Server instance named "MyInstance" running on port 1433 and using a service account named "MyDomain\MyServiceAccount", you would use the following command:

setspn -s MSSQLSvc/MyInstance:1433 MyDomain\MyServiceAccount

4. How do you check if an SPN is registered for a SQL Server service?
You can use the SETSPN utility to check if an SPN is registered for a SQL Server service. The syntax for using SETSPN to check for an SPN for a SQL Server service is as follows:

setspn -L <domain>\<accountname>

where <domain>\<accountname> is the domain and account name of the SQL Server service account. This will list all the SPNs registered for the specified account.

For example, to check if an SPN is registered for a service account named "MyDomain\MyServiceAccount", you would use the following command:

setspn -L MyDomain\MyServiceAccount

5. What are some common issues with SPNs in SQL Server?
Some common issues with SPNs in SQL Server include:
Duplicate SPNs: if multiple SPNs are registered for the same service account, it can cause authentication issues
Incorrect SPNs: if the SPN is registered with the wrong hostname or port number, it can cause authentication issues
Missing SPNs: if the SPN is not registered for the SQL Server service, it will fall back to using NTLM authentication, which is less secure and does not allow for delegation
