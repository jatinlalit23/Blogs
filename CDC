I am sharing some insight onto what Change Data Capture (CDC) is and how it helps us?
If you have used it in your environment, please do share what challenges did you faced with it?

It is a amazing feature in SQL Server that captures changes made to data in a table and stores those changes in a separate table for downstream processing.
·       The feature is highly configurable and can be customized to fit a wide range of use cases.

·       CDC is enabled at the database level using the sys.sp_cdc_enable_db system stored procedure:

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db;

·       Once CDC is enabled for the database, individual tables can be enabled for CDC using the sys.sp_cdc_enable_table system stored procedure:

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
 @source_schema = N'dbo',
 @source_name = N'MyTable',
 @role_name = NULL,
 @filegroup_name = N'CDC';

·       After CDC is enabled for a table, changes can be captured using the cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes function:

SELECT * FROM cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_dbo_MyTable(
 sys.fn_cdc_get_min_lsn('dbo_MyTable'),
  sys.fn_cdc_get_max_lsn(),
 'all');

·       This function returns a result set with columns for the changed data as well as metadata such as the operation type (insert, update, delete) and the transaction ID:
bash

__$start_lsn
__$seqval
__$operation
__$update_mask
ID
Name
Email

·       CDC maintains a table to track the LSN (Log Sequence Number) of the most recent change captured, which can be retrieved using the sys.fn_cdc_get_max_lsn function:

SELECT sys.fn_cdc_get_max_lsn();

·       CDC tables can be cleaned up using the sys.sp_cdc_cleanup_change_table system stored procedure, which removes entries older than a specified retention period:

EXEC sys.sp_cdc_cleanup_change_table
 @capture_instance = N'dbo_MyTable',
 @low_water_mark = NULL,
 @threshhold = 5000;

Let me know if you learnt something new today. Happy Learning!
